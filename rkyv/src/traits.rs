/// A type that can be used without deserializing.
///
/// `Archive` is one of three basic traits used to work with zero-copy data and
/// controls the layout of the data in its archived zero-copy representation.
/// The [`Serialize`] trait helps transform types into that representation, and
/// the [`Deserialize`] trait helps transform types back out.
///
/// Types that implement `Archive` must have a well-defined archived size.
/// Unsized types can be supported using the [`ArchiveUnsized`] trait, along
/// with [`SerializeUnsized`] and [`DeserializeUnsized`].
///
/// Archiving is done depth-first, writing any data owned by a type before
/// writing the data for the type itself. The type must be able to create the
/// archived type from only its own data and its resolver.
///
/// Archived data is always treated as if it is tree-shaped, with the root
/// owning its direct descendents and so on. Data that is not tree-shaped can be
/// supported using special serializer and deserializer bounds (see
/// [`ArchivedRc`](crate::rc::ArchivedRc) for example). In a buffer of
/// serialized data, objects are laid out in *reverse order*. This means that
/// the root object is located near the end of the buffer and leaf objects are
/// located near the beginning.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Most of the time, `#[derive(Archive)]` will create an acceptable
/// implementation. You can use the `#[archive(...)]` and `#[archive_attr(...)]`
/// attributes to control how the implementation is generated. See the
/// [`Archive`](macro@crate::Archive) derive macro for more details.
///
/// ```
/// use rkyv::{Archive, Deserialize, Serialize};
///
/// #[derive(Archive, Deserialize, Serialize, Debug, PartialEq)]
/// // This will generate a PartialEq impl between our unarchived and archived types
/// #[archive(compare(PartialEq))]
/// // We can pass attributes through to generated types with archive_attr
/// #[archive_attr(derive(Debug))]
/// struct Test {
///     int: u8,
///     string: String,
///     option: Option<Vec<i32>>,

/// let value = Test {
///     int: 42,
///     string: "hello world".to_string(),
///     option: Some(vec![1, 2, 3, 4]),
/// };
///
/// // Serializing is as easy as a single function call
/// let bytes = rkyv::to_bytes::<_, 256>(&value).unwrap();
///
/// // Or you can customize your serialization for better performance
/// // and compatibility with #![no_std] environments
/// use rkyv::ser::{Serializer, serializers::AllocSerializer};
///
/// let mut serializer = AllocSerializer::<0>::default();
/// serializer.serialize_value(&value).unwrap();
/// let bytes = serializer.into_serializer().into_inner();
///
/// // You can use the safe API with the `bytecheck` feature enabled,
/// // or you can use the unsafe API (shown here) for maximum performance
/// let archived = unsafe { rkyv::archived_root::<Test>(&bytes[..]) };
/// assert_eq!(archived, &value);

/// _Note: the safe API requires the `bytecheck` feature._

/// Many of the core and standard library types already have `Archive`

///
/// In this example, we add our own wrapper that serializes a `&'static str` as
