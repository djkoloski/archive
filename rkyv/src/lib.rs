//! # rkyv
//!
//! rkyv (*archive*) is a zero-copy deserialization framework for Rust.
//!
//! It's similar to other zero-copy deserialization frameworks such as
//! [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org) and [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers).
//! However, while the former have external schemas and heavily restricted data types, rkyv allows
//! all serialized types to be defined in code and can serialize a wide variety of types that the
//! others cannot. Additionally, rkyv is designed to have little to no overhead, and in most cases
//! will perform exactly the same as native types.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! Like [serde](https://serde.rs), rkyv uses Rust's powerful trait system to serialize data without
//! the need for reflection. Despite having a wide array of features, you also only pay for what you
//! use. If your data checks out, the serialization process can be as simple as a `memcpy`! Like
//! serde, this allows rkyv to perform at speeds similar to handwritten serializers.
//!
//! Unlike serde, rkyv produces data that is guaranteed deserialization free. If you wrote your data
//! to disk, you can just `mmap` your file into memory, cast a pointer, and your data is ready to
//! use. This makes it ideal for high-performance and IO-bound applications.
//!
//! Limited data mutation is supported through `Pin` APIs, and archived values can be truly
//! deserialized with [`Deserialize`] if full mutation capabilities are needed.
//!
//! ## Type support
//!
//! rkyv has a hashmap implementation that is built for zero-copy deserialization, so you can
//! serialize your hashmaps with abandon. The implementation performs perfect hashing with the
//! compress, hash and displace algorithm to use as little memory as possible while still performing
//! fast lookups.
//!
//! rkyv also has support for contextual serialization, deserialization, and validation. It can
//! properly serialize and deserialize shared pointers like `Rc` and `Arc`, and can be extended to
//! support custom contextual types.
//!
//! One of the most impactful features made possible by rkyv is the ability to serialize trait
//! objects and use them *as trait objects* without deserialization. See the `archive_dyn` crate for
//! more details.
//!
//! ## Tradeoffs
//!
//! rkyv is designed primarily for loading bulk game data as efficiently as possible. While rkyv is
//! a great format for final data, it lacks a full schema system and isn't well equipped for data
//! migration. Using a serialization library like serde can help fill these gaps, and you can use
//! serde with the same types as rkyv conflict-free.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - `size_64`: Archives `*size` as `*64` instead of `*32`. This is for large archive support
//! - `specialization`: Enables support for the unstable specialization feature for increased
//!   performance for a few specific cases
//! - `std`: Enables standard library support (enabled by default)
//! - `strict`: Guarantees that types will have the same representations across platforms and
//!   compilations. This is already the case in practice, but this feature provides a guarantee. It
//!   additionally provides C type compatibility.
//! - `validation`: Enables validation support through `bytecheck`
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! See [`Archive`] for examples of how to use rkyv.
